Libraries:
NumPy
Pandas
Seaborn
Scikit-learn

Approach:
I used Kaggle to analyse the dataset. I loaded the dataset to examine the data. Then I manipulated the data to convert the categories into ordinal values using LabelEncoder. Then I created train and test sets. To classify the data I used Logistic Regression and KNN classification. In the end I checked my results with a confusion matrix to see if the test and train data were balanced.
